    m_Localized: "...... We all know the effect of the Dark Light mentioned above,
      but it has become something we don't pay much attention to anymore. Rather,
      we are more interested in the second effect that we are about to talk about.\r\nThe
      second effect of Dark Light is \u2018Strength\u2019. The more black light accumulates
      in the body, the more powerful the owner can be. It allows you to create the
      special abilities you want, and it also allows you to gain \u2018force\u2019,
      which is literally \u2018Strength\u2019.\r\nSo, in the early days when Dark
      Light was discovered, everything in this world was obsessed with collecting
      more Dark Light. However, despite these advantages, the problem of Dark Light

      that anyone who had accumulated a large amount of Dark Light for years had
      to experience, but they did not tell others about this fact. Some people may
      have been satisfied with the fact that it was a secret that only they knew,
      while others may not have thought that others would suffer because of it because
      overcoming it was not a big problem. Others may not have had any problems due
      to their unique constitution. In fact, the biggest reason why not everyone
      knows about this may be that there were not enough beings who could collect
      Dark Light to their limits for this issue to be made public. But this problem
      is real, and experiments on it......
