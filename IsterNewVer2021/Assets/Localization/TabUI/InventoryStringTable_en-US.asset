    m_Localized: The original form of the great sword that protruded from Opus' body
      when Opus acquired the Dark Light at first. It can perform a basic heavy slash
      attack. Since it has a name, it seems like it was a weapon used by someone,
      but I don't think the owner is known.

    m_Localized: The original form of a stabbing-only weapon that can be obtained
      from Liatris. You can perform a charged stab attack by pressing and holding
      the left mouse button. As Liatris weakens, it lost its original form, but it
      can still be useful.
