    m_Localized: A Carved Seal that someone has imprinted with own power. It seems
      to have been a very powerful person, but because so much time has passed, it
      doesn't seem to be able to demonstrate its full power. Once charged, it can
      be used 3 times, and you can recover 1 health point by concentrating for a
      short period of time. I don't know why, but charging is possible at save points.

      the power to change owner's appearance into a butterfly. When uses it, owner
      can turn into a butterfly for a certain period of time and fly through the
